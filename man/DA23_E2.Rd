\description{
This is a subset of the data from Experiment 2 of Duke and Amir (2022), excluding all answers deemed nonsensical by at least one of the lab assistants. The study investigated the impact of presenting customers with a sequential choice (first decide whether or not to buy, then pick quantity) as opposed to an integrated decision (choose not to buy, or one of different quantities) on sales and the number of items bought.
