\description{
The authors studied the effect of mindsets on long-term goals for a weight loss study. Participants were randomly assigned to one mindset,
and were asked to write a motivational statement for a website; the response variable is the number of words written, and the \code{authenticity} score measures the
participants attitude based on a four-question item using Likert scales . The study considered two contrasts and a mediation analysis for these.
