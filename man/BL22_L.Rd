\details{
The authors recruted 301 pairs of people and assigned them to either face-to-face interactions or videocall. They measured the number of ideas generated during the discussion as well as the fraction of those which were deemed creative using a `creativity_score`. The latter was measured by two undergraduates who evaluated all ideas based on novelty using a Likert scale with 7 points. Participants were asked to pick their most novel idea: the `diff` column measures the  and a `decision_error` score (with smaller values of the latter meaning better decisions).
