\description{
Study 4 focused on cultural appropriation for soul food recipe cookbook from Chef Dax, who was
either black (or not), manipulating the description of the way he obtained the recipes (by peeking without permission in kitchens, by asking permission or no mention for control).
Authors postulated that the perception of appropriation would vary by political ideology (liberal or conservative).
The study results in a 3 by 2 by 2 three-way between-subject ANOVA, followed by moderated mediation.
