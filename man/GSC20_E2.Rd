\format{
A data frame with 5810 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{id}}{[factor] participant identifier}
  \item{\code{help}}{[integer] experimental manipulation either episodic helping, or no help (\code{control})}
  \item{\code{group}}{[factor] group, either \code{in} or \code{out} group}
  \item{\code{story}}{[factor] story narrative, one from \code{A} to \code{J}}
  \item{\code{scene_imagery}}{[double] standardized score for scene imagery, "Did you imagine a scene of helping the person in your mind?",(1=not at all, 4=moderate, 7=coherently and clearly)}
  \item{\code{person_imagery}}{[double] standardized score for person imagery, "Did you visualize the person in your mind?" (1=vividly, as if you were currently there, 4=moderate, 7=not at all)}
  \item{\code{persp_taking}}{[double] standardized score on the perspective, "Did you consider the person's thoughts and feelings?" (1=not at all, 4=moderate, 7=strongly considered)}
  \item{\code{willing_help}}{[double] standardized score for willingess to help, "How likely would you be to help in this situation?" (1=not at all, 4=moderately willing, 7=very willing)}
}

\description{
Data obtained by running an online survey on Qualtrics. Self-report questions on thoughts, feeling and self-attributes, in the context of a competition between parties. Participants reported their political preferences, but were randomly allocated to either Democrat or Republican team. The description implied a problem-solving challenge (which did not occur).
}
\note{
The participant demographic information is given in the attributes as metadata.

# Authors coded -1/1 for group and help
