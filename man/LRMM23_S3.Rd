\description{
Paired data from dyads: participants were asked to "name a fellow college student in their social circle with whom they typically have pleasant encounters but have not interacted (either virtually or in-person)". The experimenter measured the appreciation score via a Likert scale with not at all (\code{1}), slightly (\code{2}), moderately (\code{3}), very \code{4} and extremely (\code{5}). The expectation of the authors was that initiators sending the gift/message would underestimate how much this attention would be valued by respondant
