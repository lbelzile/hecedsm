A data frame with 802 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{pef}}{[double] vector of perceived environmental friendliness}
  \item{\code{mcheck}}{[double] manipulation check for proportion}
  \item{\code{proportion}}{[double] proportion of plastic to paper}

\description{
The study considers the environmental perception of packaging when
objects contain paper/cardboard wrapping, in addition to plastic container. The
authors postulated that the more the quantity of paper, the more ecofriendly the
package was perceived to be and that this relations increases with the proportion
of paper wrapping relative to plastic. The study used a between-subject design with
four categories, and recruited 802 participants on MTurk.
