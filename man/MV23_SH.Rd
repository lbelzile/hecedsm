\description{
After completing an unrelated study, the authors proposed to participants on MTurk to donate of their time for a social cause (net neutrality) by completing an optional survey for a prosocial cause. Participants were assigned to the open-ended choice or offered to complete up to 3 additional sections with demographics (1), plus internet use (2) and political attitudes (3). The study aims to study generosity, but without involving windfall.
